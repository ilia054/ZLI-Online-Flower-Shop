  # ZLI-Online-Flower-Shop
ZLI is a Distributed Flower Shop (TCP\IP) network protocol created in my 5th semester as a part of the mid througth project.
Zli is an online flower shop, that utilizes the OCSF java API (TCP\IP) network protocol, along side JavaFX,SceneBuilder,JFX,FontAwesome,JavaMail and more External API's.
The project was made out of 3 parts
1:Getting the story from the "Client" and creating UML diagrams 
2:Creating Package Diagrams, architecture design, UI\UX design and choosing the correct correct development method (AGILE)
3:Hard coding the project, along side of Unit testing and Functional testing (Mockito,Jubula,JUnit frame work)

This project was written using Java 1.8_321 Compiler, in a windows enviorment.
The DB was stored in MySql.

This project mimics an online flower shop, where a customer can create an order,have it shipped to it, create a complaint about it and much more

There are several "Users" in the system:
1.CEO
2.Customers
3.Customer Service employee
4.Delivery Men
5.Marketing Employee
6.Store Manager
7.Store Employee
8.Customer service expert

All of them have different functionalities,all according to the clients story

                                                                        Create an order
